# House Price Prediction
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression to estimate the price of a house based on one key feature, such as the size of the house (in square feet). This project demonstrates the use of basic machine learning concepts to understand the relationship between a house's price and its size.
