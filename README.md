# House Price Prediction
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression to estimate the price of a house based on one key feature, such as the size of the house (in square feet). This project demonstrates the use of basic machine learning concepts to understand the relationship between a house's price and its size.
#
## 1. Problem Statement:
In the real estate market, predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and agents. By analyzing historical data, we aim to create a model that predicts house prices using only the house size (in square feet) as the independent variable. This simple model will help understand how the size of a house influences its market value.
#
## 2. Project Scope:
### Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that contains the size of houses and their corresponding sale prices. The dataset may also include other features, but for this project, we will focus on one feature: house size.

### Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a format suitable for regression analysis.

## Model Development:
 Implement simple linear regression where the house price is the dependent variable, and house size is the independent variable.
 Use a statistical or machine learning library (like Python’s scikit-learn or R’s lm function) to train the model.
 Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) values.
 
### Prediction: Once trained, use the model to predict the price of new houses based on their size.
