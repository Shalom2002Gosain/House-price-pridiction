# House Price Prediction
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression to estimate the price of a house based on one key feature, such as the size of the house (in square feet). This project demonstrates the use of basic machine learning concepts to understand the relationship between a house's price and its size.
#
## 1. Problem Statement:
In the real estate market, predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and agents. By analyzing historical data, we aim to create a model that predicts house prices using only the house size (in square feet) as the independent variable. This simple model will help understand how the size of a house influences its market value.
#
## 2. Project Scope:
* Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that contains the size of houses and their corresponding sale prices. The dataset may also include other features, but for this project, we will focus on one feature: house size.

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a format suitable for regression analysis.

* Model Development:
 Implement simple linear regression where the house price is the dependent variable, and house size is the independent variable.
 Use a statistical or machine learning library (like Python’s scikit-learn or R’s lm function) to train the model.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) values.
 
* Prediction: Once trained, use the model to predict the price of new houses based on their size.
#
## 3. Tools & Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python (or R)
* Libraries:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
* NumPy: For mathematical operations
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance
* scikit-learn: For implementing linear regression and model evaluation
* Dataset: You can use publicly available datasets like:
 Kaggle’s "House Sales in King County" dataset
 UCI Machine Learning Repository’s "Housing" dataset
#
## 4. Expected Outcomes:
A simple linear regression model capable of predicting house prices based on size.
Insights into how the size of a house influences its price in the real estate market.
A foundation for extending this project to multiple linear regression, where more features (like location, number of bedrooms, etc.) could be included to improve prediction accuracy.
#
## Conclusion: This project provides a hands-on experience with basic machine learning techniques, focusing on predicting house prices using simple linear regression. While this approach considers only one feature, it serves as an introduction to predictive modeling, allowing for future enhancements such as adding more variables or using more complex algorithms.
